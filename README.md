Navbar:
It includes a responsive navbar with my own logo, and 3 links to the abovementioned pages. The toggle navbar will not be working (as expected) on small screens as this requires jquery or javascript which is not covered in this homework.

Footer:
It includes a sticky footer.

General Color Scheme:
The color scheme is white, dark grey and red.
